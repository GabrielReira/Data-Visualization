# [Time Series] Crypto Currency Dataset

In this project I did a simple app that contains multiple pages. The objective was to know how to manage an application that demands more than one visualization for the data. Besides, I was using an external css file to better lay out the elements.

One of the pages has a multi dropdown control that allows the user to choose cryptos and a checklist to control the variables that will be displayed on the graph. On the other page, the user can compare, side by side, two cryptocurrencies and analyse them with candlestick, line and boxplot graphs.
